# Team126-Final-Project

1. We used a external function called bubble to make the bubble plot
   In order to activate this code sucessfully, you need to download the bubble package by run following code

   #install.packages(devtools)
   library("devtools")
   devtools::install_github("jcheng5/bubbles")
   
   These codes are for you to download the bubble package
   
2. We also have other countries dataset that can analyze. However, they are so huge that it can not be uploaded by github.
